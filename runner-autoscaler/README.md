# Autoscaler

#### Creates/Deletes VM instances depending on GitHub workflow jobs webhook events

A webserver is listening for GitHub "Workflow jobs" webhook events. Depending on the workflow job, a VM instance will be either created or deleted. The [10 second timeout](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/best-practices-for-using-webhooks#respond-within-10-seconds) of the GitHub webhook has to be worked around (10 sec are not enough to start VM instance) by using a Clout Task queue that calls the webserver back with an increased timeout of 180 seconds (can be configured).

### Scaling rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the scaler is configured incorrectly, this can lead to “dangling” computing instances, resulting in unnecessary costs.

Following conditions of the workflow job webhook event have to be fulfilled, so a new VM instance will be **created**:

* The (enterprise, organization, repository) webhook source was configured and the webhook signature is valid (see GITHUB_ENTERPRISE, GITHUB_ORG, GITHUB_REPOS).
* The webhook `action` value equals `queued`.
* **All** labels of the workflow job match the configured RUNNER_LABELS.

Following conditions of the workflow job webhook event have to be fulfilled, so an existing VM instance will be **deleted**:

* The (enterprise, organization, repository) webhook source was configured and the webhook signature is valid (see GITHUB_ENTERPRISE, GITHUB_ORG, GITHUB_REPOS).
* The webhook `action` value equals `completed`.
* The webhook `workflow_job.runner_group_id` value equals the configured RUNNER_GROUP_ID.
* **All** labels of the workflow job match the configured RUNNER_LABELS.

### Configuration

The scaler is configured via the following environment variables:
